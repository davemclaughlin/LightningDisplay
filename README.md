# LightningDisplay

Environment and Lightning detector display running on a G120 Cobra 2 board from GHI with 5" LCD capacitive touch.

Custom solution integrated with my Home Automation system to capture data via Zigbee from the Lightning Detector and HTTP from Homeseer.

Most of the sensors send their data to Homeseer via the JSON HTTP service and this unit picks up that data every 5 seconds.
